# StaticBlogspot
Clever code used to host a static website on Blogger/Blogspot servers owned by Google. Benefits of hosting a site on Blogger is it's reliable, cheap, and easy to manage a custom domain name with Google Domains. 

## Getting Started

With clever programming using if statements within the HTML code, we can tell Blogger servers to display the correct code based on the URL the web browser is browsing to. To start copy and past the code and edit the html, css, and js code to your liking. 

### Prerequisites

1) Blogger/Google account
2) Code/text editor (I use Visual Studio Code)

### Installing

1) Login to Blogger
2) Using the navigation pane on the left, navigate to "Theme", click the down arrow next to the "Customize", then click on "Edit HTML"
3) Copy and paste the html code into the Blogger editor (You'll need to edit/customize the code for your website)
4) Click save.
